# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

Dev branch should be used with extreme caution, mostly broken builds of WIP

Beta branch should be safe for keen users to try new features, but is not guarranteed to work.

## [3.1.4] - 2025-04-09
### Breaking Change
- Battery Calibration is now split into two entities, one sensor for status plus a switch to turn on or off calibration. This fixes the issue on failing to start GivTCP during a calibration

- Additional device type compatability in underlying library (future use)
- Prep for PV only inverters



## [3.0.4] - 2024-10-22
